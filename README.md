# Diabetes Prediction Model

This is a research project aimed at predicting whether a person has diabetes or not using a logistic regression model. The project involves performing data exploration, data pre-processing, building a regression model, evaluating the model, and reporting the results.

## Objectives
### Main Objective:
Predicting whether a person has diabetes or not.

### Specific Objectives:
Perform data exploration
Perform data pre-processing
Build a logistic regression model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not
Evaluate the model and report the results

## Metrics For Success
The project will be considered successful if it achieves the following:

Feature engineering to extract meaningful features for the model.
A detailed interpretation of the statistical and economical significance of the model.

## Context
Prediction of diabetes at an early stage can lead to improved treatment. Data mining techniques are widely used for the prediction of diseases at an early stage. In this research project, diabetes is predicted using significant attributes using a logistic regression model.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

**Data Exploration** : Jupyter Notebook file containing code for exploring and analyzing the dataset.
**Data Pre-processing**: Jupyter Notebook file containing code for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
**Model Building**: Jupyter Notebook file containing code for building and training the logistic regression model.
**Model Evaluation**: Jupyter Notebook file containing code for evaluating the performance of the model and reporting the results.

# Results
The results of the project, including the performance metrics and interpretation of the model, are documented in the Model Evaluation notebook.

# Conclusion
In this project, we have successfully built a logistic regression model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not. The model achieved an accuracy of .98% on the test set, indicating its potential to be useful in predicting diabetes at an early stage.
