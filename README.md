# 1)  Defining the question

a) Objectives

Main objective: 

Predicting whether a person has diabetes or not.

Specific objectives:

 Perform 
- Data exploration
- Data pre-processing
- Build the regression model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
- Evaluate the model and report the results


b) Metrics For success

Should have:
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful features fro the model.
- A detailed interpretation of the statistical and economical significance

c) Context

Prediction of diabetes at an early stage can lead to improved treatment. Data mining techniques are widely used for prediction of disease at an early stage. In this research project, diabetes is predicted using significant attributes using logistic regression model.
